# U.S. Real GDP Forecasting Project

This repository contains code and analysis for a project focused on forecasting U.S. real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using time series analysis techniques, particularly SARIMA models. The project aims to provide insights into the behavior of U.S. real GDP from 2022 to 2023 and generate accurate predictions for future GDP values.

## Introduction

The forecasting project utilizes SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models to predict future U.S. real GDP values based on historical data. By leveraging time series analysis techniques, the project aims to assist policymakers, economists, and businesses make informed decisions regarding economic trends and developments.

## Data

The project utilizes historical U.S. real GDP data from reputable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database. The dataset covers quarterly GDP values from 2022 to 2023, providing a comprehensive basis for analysis and forecasting.

## Analysis

The analysis begins with data preprocessing steps, including transformations and decomposition, to identify underlying trends and seasonality patterns in the GDP data. SARIMA models are then fitted to the preprocessed data, with various parameter configurations tested to find the best-fitting model. Diagnostic checks, including residual analysis and model evaluation metrics such as AICc, are performed to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the selected model.

## Results

The forecasting results are presented through visualizations and comparisons of model forecasts against actual GDP values. Evaluation metrics such as AICc are used to assess the performance of the models and determine the best-fitting model configuration. The README includes detailed explanations of the results, highlighting the accuracy of the forecasts and their implications for understanding U.S. economic trends.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the forecasting project provides valuable insights into the behavior of U.S. real GDP from 2022 to 2023. The SARIMA models demonstrate effectiveness in capturing and predicting GDP dynamics, enabling stakeholders to anticipate future economic trends and make informed decisions. The project contributes to a better understanding of the U.S. economy and provides actionable insights for policymakers, economists, and businesses.
